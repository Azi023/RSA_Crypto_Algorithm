# RSA Encryption Project

This project implements RSA encryption and decryption using Python. It provides a user-friendly GUI for encrypting and decrypting files of any type and size. Performance metrics such as encryption/decryption time, CPU usage, and memory usage are displayed after each operation.

## Features

- Generate RSA keys of varying sizes (1024, 2048, 4096 bits).
- Encrypt and decrypt any file type (text, images, videos, etc.).
- Display performance metrics after encryption and decryption.
- User-friendly interface using PySimpleGUI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- See `requirements.txt` for Python package dependencies.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository or Extract the Zip File:**
